As a person with lots of things on, I want to stay organised by using my to do list app.
This app should let me assign importance and urgency levels to my tasks,
and sort my tasks into categories and subcategories such as work (work projects),
admin (money, house, work admin etc).

Optional features: email reminders for urgent tasks. Optional regular reminders for ongoing tasks.
